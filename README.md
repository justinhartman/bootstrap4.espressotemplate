### Theme Options

The following screenshot outlines the various options available to you when you
create a _New Project_ within `Espresso`.

![Theme Options](docs/images/theme-options.png)

### Extras

There is an optional Extras section which allows you to include extra
configuration files that form part of most modern-day web projects.

In the `Theme Options` you will find the following settings for you to choose
from:

![Theme Options](docs/images/extras.png)

These extras are:

1. **IE Classes:** this includes markup in your HTML document for IE9 that will
   display a browser upgrade message. When selecting this option a new
   `browser-upgrade.css` file is included in your `/css/` folder and is linked
   in your HTML markup. If you don't select this option then no additional
   markup or CSS is added to your HTML template.
1. **Server Extras:** includes an `.htaccess`, `robots.txt` and `humans.txt`
   file in the root of your project folder. You can edit these files and
   customise them to your needs. This option is selected by default as these
   files are recommended but if you don't select them then none of these files
   are added to your project.
1. **Google Analytics:** by including this, additional Google Analytics code is
   included in your markup just before the closing `</body>` tag. You have the
   option of inputting your Site ID at time of creating your template or, if you
   only create the GA tag later on, you can add the Site ID to the markup later
   on. If this option is unticked, no additional code is added to your markup.
